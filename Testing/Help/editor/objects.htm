  Objects</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are many 
  additional types of objects that can be used to spice up your level and create 
  new effects.&nbsp; Each of these can be created by selecting them in the <b>Objects</b> 
  window and clicking them in on the background.</font></p>
<ul>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">TIP: 
    When adding objects, you can use the commands Control-C for copy, Control-V 
    for paste, and Control-X for cut.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</a></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Barrels</b> 
  can be placed through a level, which explode when they are shot. &nbsp; Double 
  clicking on them brings up a dialog where you can set them to be destructible 
  only by the player.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are several 
  types of <b>Mines</b> which can be created.&nbsp; <b>Proximity mines</b> detonate 
  when someone gets within a certain distance. <b>Timed mines</b> go off after 
  a set amount of time.&nbsp; <b>Bouncing betty</b> mines go off and shoot shrapnel 
  into the air when someone gets within close proximity..</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>Sentry</b> 
  is an automatic gun which senses and tracks the Postal dude. &nbsp; By double 
  clicking on it, you can set how much ammo it holds (<b>Ammo supply</b>), how 
  long it will wait before shooting (<b>shot delay</b> in milliseconds), how close 
  the Postal dude needs to be before it can shoot (<b>range</b> in pixels), and 
  how fast it can turn (<b>rotational vol</b> in degrees per second).</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">TIP:&nbsp; 
    Sentry guns cannot be killed with bullets. &nbsp; (Everyone knows bullets 
    can't make a big, metal gun explode.)&nbsp; This can make them tough to kill.&nbsp; 
    To make a sentry easier to kill, try putting a barrel next to it.&nbsp; When 
    you kill the barrel, the sentry will also die.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Ostrich</b> 
  can make fun and easy targets.&nbsp; They just run around and put their heads 
  in the dirt.&nbsp; They have no weapons, are easy to kill, and have something 
  related to panic logic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Band</b> members 
  are also fun and easy targets.&nbsp; Once they are placed, double click on them 
  to select what type of instrument they play.&nbsp; Band members will use a bouy 
  network and use panic-type logic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Power ups</b> 
  can be set to contain whatever you wish, including all types of ammo, weapons, 
  health, and kevlar vests.&nbsp; You can also place the power up in a backpack.&nbsp; 
  If you have more than one type of item in a power up, it will automatically 
  be placed in a box.&nbsp; The power up will take on the look of whatever type 
  of item it contains.&nbsp; When you place a power up, it will automatically 
  display a dialog to choose what's in it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>Flag</b> 
  and <b>Flagbase</b> are used in many of the &quot;challenge&quot; missions.&nbsp; 
  The Postal dude will automatically pick up flags as he runs over them and will 
  automatically place them in a base as he runs by one.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>AnimThing</b> 
  places an animation on the background.&nbsp; You must know the name of the .aan 
  file to use this because there is no way to browse for them within the Editor. 
  &nbsp; Fire.aan is one example.&nbsp; However, if you place a fire, it won't 
  actually hurt anyone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Item3d</b> allows 
  you to place certain other 3d items on your level.&nbsp; Right now, it can place 
  horns, saxophones, and trumpets from the Band members.&nbsp; You can also set 
  how quickly it will rotate on both the Y and the Z axis.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="Dispensers">Dispensers</a></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Dispensers</b> 
  are one of the most versatile items in Postal.&nbsp; They spew out whatever 
  you select, in the quantities you choose, based on the parameters you set. &nbsp; 
  When you place a dispenser, a dialog will appear which allows you to set the 
  &quot;dispensee&quot; and how it will be dispensed.&nbsp; If you choose something 
  which can be edited further (like a Person), click on the <b>Edit Dispensee...</b> 
  button located next to the OK button.&nbsp; If you choose something which has 
  no properties to edit (like an Ostrich), clicking on that button will close 
  the dialog.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">TIP:&nbsp; 
    You can ALT - Double click a dispenser to jump straight into editing the dispensee.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dispensers can 
  be set with one of three <b>logic types</b>.&nbsp; <b>Timed</b> sends out the 
  object based on an amount of time.&nbsp; It allows you to set the <b>initial 
  delay</b> before dispensing begins, and the <b>minimum</b> and <b>maximum</b> 
  amount of time before the next object is dispensed.&nbsp; <b>Exists</b> sends 
  out an object based on when the last dispensee was killed or destroyed.&nbsp; 
  It allows you set the <b>initial delay</b>, and the <b>minimum</b> and <b>maximum</b> 
  amount of time before the next object is dispensed after the previous one is 
  destroyed.&nbsp; <b>Distance to Dude</b> sends out an object based on how close 
  the Postal dude gets to the dispenser.&nbsp; It allows you to set the <b>initial 
  delay</b>, <b>minimum</b> and <b>maximum</b> distance the Postal dude must be 
  to dispense, and how often it will check to see if the dude is within that area.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dispensers can 
  also be set to dispense only a limited number of that item or they can be set 
  to be infinite, by checking the box.&nbsp; Dispensers are invisible when playing 
  your level, but show up as the item you have chosen with a 25¢ symbol on them.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">TIP:&nbsp; 
    Dispensers can be used to create all kinds of unique effects, so try experimenting 
    with them to see what you can do.&nbsp; One example is the exploding toilets 
    on the Construction level.&nbsp; These were made with a barrel dispenser set 
    on Exist with a short enough delay so that the replacement barrel explodes 
    in the fire of the previous barrel.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="SoundThings">SoundThings</a></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As sound is such 
  an important part of playing Postal, the <b>SoundThing</b> has many options.&nbsp; 
  It enables you to add in ambient sounds like wind, birds, phone sex, etc. &nbsp; 
  After placing a SoundThing, double click on it to set its properties.&nbsp; 
  Type in the name of the sound (<a href="/editor/sounds.htm">click here for available 
  sounds</a>).</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">TIP:&nbsp; 
    Adding the <b>Demon</b> object to the world creates that booming voice that 
    taunts the enemies and congratulates you while you play.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first set of 
  choices allows you to set a range from when the sound will first play to when 
  it will play again.&nbsp; <b>First Minimum Time</b> is the minimum time until 
  the sound will first play.&nbsp; <b>First Random Time</b> is what creates a 
  range to decide when the sound will play.&nbsp; Postal will pick a random number 
  between zero and &nbsp; First Random Time, which it adds to First Minimum Time 
  to decide when the sound will first play.&nbsp; An example might make it more 
  clear:&nbsp; If you choose 1000 for the First Minimum Time and 2000 for the 
  First Random Time, the first sound will play somewhere between 2 and 3 seconds.&nbsp; 
  Repeat Minimum Time and Repeat Random Time do the same thing for additional 
  times that the sound will be played.&nbsp; It was set up this way so that sounds 
  would have a more realistic quality rather than repeating at only one interval.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Select initial 
  status</b> must be set at <b>Enable</b> in order for the SoundThing to be heard.&nbsp; 
  Setting the second field to Repeat will tell the SoundThing to use the random 
  time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>Sound Volume 
  Half Life</b> is how far the sound will &quot;carry&quot;. &nbsp; You will notice 
  this effect with some of the street lights in Postal.&nbsp; As you get closer 
  to them, you can hear the buzz of the florescent lights get louder.&nbsp; The 
  lower the number, the closer you have to be to hear the sound.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When checked, <b>Use 
  looping</b> opens several more choices.&nbsp; <b>Loop back to</b> allows you 
  to start your second loop at a point other than the beginning of the sound.&nbsp; 
  <b>Loop back from</b> allows you to stop your the loop at a point other than 
  the end.&nbsp; If you check <b>End</b>, the SoundThing will loop back from the 
  end of the sound.&nbsp; <b>Number of times to loop back</b> can be set to a 
  finite number or to infinite.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When checked,<b> 
  Purge Sample when done playing</b> will read the sound off the CD or hard drive 
  (depending on how the player installed Postal) rather than leaving the sound 
  in memory.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If <b>Ambient Sound</b> 
  is checked, means the player can turn the sound off if they turn off Ambient 
  Sounds in their Options - Performance&nbsp; menu.&nbsp; If you do not check 
  the box, the player will not be able to turn off that sound even if they turn 
  off Ambient Sounds for performance reasons.</font></p>
